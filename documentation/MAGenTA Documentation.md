#### Overview

MAGenTA is a command-line based tool for Transposon Insertion Sequencing (Tn-Seq) data analysis. It was developed to analyze data generated by the method outlined in [van Opijnen 2009](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v6/n10/abs/nmeth.1377.html), which unlike other transposon insertion sequencing methods (cite here), assesses organismal fitness by profiling the mutant library at two time points, typically before and after a challenge (i.e. an antibiotic) is presented. The MAGenTA pipeline tools differ from other Tn-Seq analysis tools in that they perform comparative analyses that include this fitness measurement, rather than only looking at insertion representation.

### <center>DataOverview</center>
<center>Characterizing the reference genome and genome-wide insertion data</center>
***

Prior to Tn-seq data analysis it is important to understand the genome-wide scale and context of the data. Large differences in sequencing coverage, insertion representation, and GC content between genomes can affect the robustness of the comparative analyses performed by MAGenTA. Tn-Seq is also generally performed with replicate libraries, where differences (if they exist) would be important to know. The DataOverview tool produces a summary of genome-wide insertion representation and inherent genome characteristics. The input data are queried for TA sites and insertions with respect to

    1. The genome
    2. Open reading frames denoted by start and stop codons
    3. Annotated genes from the Genbank record
    4. Intergenic regions

#### USAGE

```perl
perl dataOverview.pl -d inputs/ -f genome.fasta -r genome.gbk
```
    REQUIRED
    -d  Directory containing all input files (results files from calc fitness script)
        OR In the command line (without a flag), input the file names
    -f  Filename for genome sequence, in fasta format
    -r  Filename for genome annotation, in GenBank format

    OPTIONAL
    -h  Print usage
    -c  Cutoff average(c1+c2)>c. Default: 15
    -o  Filename for output. Default: standard output


#### Output

The DataOverview tool outputs a summary of genome and gene-wide insertion representation for each library, including how many insertions would be filtered out given a cutoff requirement for the number of reads representing each insertion.

### <center>GeneCompare: Comparative gene analysis for the same organism</center>
***

Comparative gene analysis for two experiments of the same organism (i.e. One strain tested in Glucose and in Glucose+Antibiotic) involves merging two output files from the fitness script, then performing a t-test and calculating average fitness difference for each gene. This process can be performed in a spreadsheet applciation, such as Excel. However, GeneCompare can perform it in less than five seconds for 2000 gene.

#### Usage

```perl
perl compGenes.pl <options> <aggregate1.csv> <aggregate2.csv> 
```

    REQUIRED
    -d  Directory containing all input files (results files from calc fitness script)
        OR In the command line (without a flag), input the file names

    OPTIONAL
    -h  Print usage
    -o  Filename for output
    -l  Labels for input files. Default: filenames
        Two strings, comma separated (i.e. -l expt1,expt2).
        Order should match file order.
        

***
### <center>StrainCompare: Comparative gene analysis for different organisms</center>
***

The StrainCompare tool, a variation of GeneCompare, is specifically for gene comparisons across two experiments from <i>different</i> organisms/strains. Since gene identification numbers will be different at the organism/strain level, a file containing the homologous genes is required. The same output as GeneCompare will be produced and can be used in downstream analysis tools. An automated method for extracting homologous genes will be a useful future improvement to this tool.

#### USAGE

```perl
perl compStrains.pl <options> -c conversion.csv [aggregateFile1.csv aggregateFile2.csv OR -d directory/]
```

    REQUIRED
    -d  Directory containing all input files (results files from calc fitness script)
        OR In the command line (without a flag), input the file names
    -c  Tab delimited file with homologous genes

    OPTIONAL
    -h  Print usage
    -o  Filename for output. Default: compFile1File2.csv
    -l  Labels for input files. Default: filenames
        Two strings, comma separated (i.e. -l expt1,expt2).
        Order should match file order.

### <center>SlidingWindow: Discovering important unannotated regions</center>
***

The method for calculating the aggregate fitness value of a gene relies on the genomic start and end coordinates of the region, which is retrievable from the organism’s Genbank record. However, not all official genome records are complete or well annotated beyond genes. At the same time, it has been shown that non-coding RNAs have an important role in virulence and other functions. Therefore, to enable discovery of such regions that may have an important fitness value to the organism, this tools uses a  sliding window approach to mine Tn-Seq data in a non-gene-centric manner. 

#### Determining window size and step
The entire genome and ordered Tn-Seq data is scanned by performing assessments of regions at a set size (base pair length of window) and step (base pairs between the start of each window). Based on the genome used, typically a window size between 250 bp and 500 bp is small enough to pick up intergenic regions or gene domains but large enough to contain enough TA sites and insertions. However, this can vary depending on organism and insertion density. The DataOverview tool can help determine these factors.
</break>

#### Method
In each regional profile, the aggregate fitness cost for insertions and the insertion representation in that region is calculated. To assess insertion representation, we follow the method used by Zhang et. al.14. For a given region, with x insertions and n TA sites, 10,000 random sets of n TA sites are selected and the average of insertions over TA sites is calculated for each. The 10,000 resulting means create a null distribution. The p-value can be derived for the original region of interest by ranking it on the distribution for x/n. A statistically underrepresented number of insertions for a region will be significant if the p-value is below the critical value. Gene annotations are also recorded if they are contained in the region. In the future, a function to identify promoter regions based on -10 and -35 box sequences and domain regions will be useful. 

#### Run time
SlidingWindow performs the fitness and insertion representation assessments in approximately 8 minutes for a two-thousand base pair genome with ~70% TA site saturation. For the Tn-Seq data from two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae grown in two conditions, 211,151 regions (300 bp) across the 2,112,148 bp genome were profiled using this approach and later used for comparative analyses.

### <center>WindowCompare: Comparative analysis of small, unannotated regions </center>
***

WindowCompare takes results from the SlidingWindow tool and performs a similar comparative analysis as done on genes by GeneCompare and StrainCompare for genes. Since start and end coordinates define windows (or regions), only comparisons between datasets from the <i>same</i> organism (same genome) can be performed. 
</break>

#### USAGE

```perl
perl compWindows.pl <options> [slidingWindows1.csv slidingWindows2.csv OR -d directory]
```

    REQUIRED
    -d  Directory containing all input files (results files from slidingWindow)
        OR In the command line (without a flag), input the file names

    OPTIONAL
    -h  Print usage and exits program
    -l  Labels for input files. Default: filenames
        Two strings, comma separated (i.e. -l expt1,expt2).
        Order should match file order.
    -o  Filename for output. Default: label1label2.csv


#### Filtering comparison results
Beginning with the comparison file for sliding windows (output of WindowCompare), filter based on cutoffs, then the Grouper tool can group consecutive regions that are labeled as important and the CustomWindow tool can recalculate the fitness and insertion representation in these expanded regions for higher quantitative resolution. Regions are classified as intergenic if there are no gene ids recorded for that entry. A frequency distribution of all genes for the selected regions illustrates how many regions there are for each gene and how many are intergenic.

#### Example analysis of slidingwindow output

![alt text](https://github.com/antmarge/magenta/blob/master/figures/fig2.png?raw=true "MAGenTA fig2")

In the example shown, over 200,000 300-bp windows for Tn-Seq data from Taiwan-19F grown in glucose and the presence of daptomycin are assessed for conditionally important regions using the adjusted p-value (FDR) and fitness difference between the two conditions. As shown in the yellow highlighted area, 583 regions met the criteria for having adjusted p-values below a critical value of 0.01 and a fitness difference greater than 0.1. Distributions of regions in 20 unique genes and two intergenic regions are shown in the table.

### <center>GvizTnSeq: Track visualization of Tn-Seq multi-feature data</center>
***
 	
To visualize a given region’s sequence, annotation, and insertions we use an adapted R package, Gviz, in R. The MAGenTA pipeline adaptation consists of three main functions that draw upon ones already built in the package. However, first file types must be formatted for input as track features in Gviz. For the main data track, multiple library files containing the insertion coordinates and fitness values are aggregated to produce a file containing unique insertions with a single fitness value using the SingleFit tool. For the annotation track, gene coordinates, transcription direction, and id are extracted from the Genbank record using the GetGeneFeatures tool and features specifically formatted for Gviz input.  Finally, the sequence track accepts the genome fasta file. Once these three files are uploaded in Rstudio, the customized Tn-Seq functions can be used to visualize regions by gene id or start and end coordinates with at most two experiments in the same window (Fig.3). 
</break>

#### USAGE


```r

getTracks<-function(fromCoord,toCoord,x1,x2)
```
    
    fromCoord  start genomic coordinate for the highlighted region
    toCoord    end genomic coordinate for the highlighted region
    x1         start coordinate for the viewing window (default: fromCoord)
    x2         end coordinate for the viewing window (default: toCoord)
